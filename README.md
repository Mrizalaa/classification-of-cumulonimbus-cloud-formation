## Classification of cumulonimbus cloud formation based on Himawari-8 images using convolutional neural networks
Cumulonimbus clouds (Cb) are clouds that are dangerous for many human activities. To reduce this effect, we need a system to classify formations. The formation of Cb clouds can be seen in the Himawari-8 IR image. This research aims to create a Cb cloud classification system with Himawari-8 IR Enhanced imagery using the GoogleNet model CNN method. The total data to be used is 2026 image data. Parameter testing was carried out on the CNN Googlenet model in this study, namely the data distribution ratio of 90:10 and 80:20. The probability of dropout is 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8. and batch sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64. The results of the trials conducted in this study yielded a sensitivity value of 100.00%, an accuracy of 99.00%, and a specificity of 99.60% obtained from the experimental data distribution of 90: 10, probability 0.8, and batch size 8
